# How to write good book feedback?
- When writing book feedback, it's important to be specific and detailed in your comments.
- Start by summarizing your overall impression of the book and whether you enjoyed it or not.
- Then, discuss specific aspects of the book that you liked or didn't like.
  - For example, if you enjoyed the characters, explain why you felt that way and provide specific examples.
  - If there were parts of the book that you found confusing or didn't understand, explain why and what you think could have been done differently.
  - Additionally, consider including any suggestions for future readers or the author.
- It's also important to be respectful and constructive in your feedback.
